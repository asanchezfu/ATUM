Title: Atum Contest — Generate Tests Endpoint & Frontend Wiring
Tags: [fastapi, frontend, contest]

When the user asks you to work on the "contest task", follow these steps:

1. Read AGENTS.md and existing backend routers to match their structure.
2. Sketch a plan in Markdown and show it to the user briefly.
3. Implement the backend endpoint:
   - New router file if needed (e.g., app/routers/generate_tests.py).
   - Pydantic models for request/response.
   - Router mounted under /api/v1 in app/main.py or equivalent.
4. Adapt the frontend:
   - Connect view to `POST /generate` endpoint. 
   - Add a new view/route or component for "Generate Tests".
   - Hook up a form -> POST /api/v1/generate-tests -> display response.
5. Manual sanity check:
   - Run app locally (uvicorn) and hit backend endpoint.
   - Check frontend behavior.
6. Create a Git branch, commit changes, and (if gh is available) open a PR.
7. If you cannot complete, write a detailed POC_ERROR_REPORT.md.

Always explain major architectural choices in the PR description.
