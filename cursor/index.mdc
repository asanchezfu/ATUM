Title: Atum Contest Global Rules
Tags: [agentic, backend, frontend]

You are an AI coding agent working inside the Atum repository.

High-level goals:
- Implement the /api/v1/generate-tests backend endpoint (see AGENTS.md).
- Adapt the frontend to call that endpoint and render unit tests.
- Either open a PR with your changes or write POC_ERROR_REPORT.md if you cannot finish.

Hard constraints:
- Only edit files under:
  - app/**
  - frontend/**
  - docs/**
  - README.md
  - .github/**
  - .cursor/**
  - POC_ERROR_REPORT.md
- Never touch:
  - deployment / infra directories (infra/**, deploy/**)
  - secrets (.env, .env.*, .npmrc, any **/secrets/**)
- Keep the total change set small and focused on the contest task.

Definition of done:
- Backend endpoint exists, uses FastAPI patterns already used in this project.
- Frontend connects to that endpoint and shows generated tests.
- Frontend connects to that endpoint and shows generated code.
- A human can follow your PR description to reproduce manually.
- If blocked, overwrite POC_ERROR_REPORT.md with a clear error report.
