# âš¡ Atum â€“ AI-Powered Code Generation & Evaluation  

Atum is an AI-driven developer assistant that transforms natural language queries into **production-ready code**.  
It integrates **LLMs** (via Ollama, OpenAI, or other providers) with a modular backend and a modern frontend, enabling developers to generate, validate, and refine code across multiple languages.  

---

## âœ¨ Features  
- **Multi-Language Code Generation** â€“ Python, JavaScript, Java, and more.  
- **Smart Evaluation** â€“ Future integration with PyTorch models for correctness and style checks.  
- **LangChain Orchestration** â€“ Prompt templates, chaining workflows, and tool integrations.  
- **Frontend + Backend** â€“ React UI with FastAPI backend for code generation and evaluation.  
- **Flexible LLM Providers** â€“ Works with local models (Ollama) or external APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic).

## ðŸš€ Vision  
Atum is more than just code generation:  
- **Generates** solutions from natural language prompts  
- **Validates & improves** outputs with automated checks  
- **Produces** unit tests, documentation, and quality reports  
- **Iteratively refines** code until it meets standards

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python  
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS  
- **LLM Integration:** Ollama, OpenAI API, LangChain  
- **ML/Evaluation (planned):** PyTorch  
- **Database (planned):** PostgreSQL / Vector DB
